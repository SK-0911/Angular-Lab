# Angular-Lab

- Model and view can be defined in same file
- Controller can be defined in another file
- When an empty array [] is passed as the second parameter, it means that the new module has no dependencies on any other module. In other words, it is a standalone module that does not require any other AngularJS modules to be loaded before it.
